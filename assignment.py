# Period:
# Python Skills Check — Slides 1–60

# ============================================================
# DIRECTIONS
# ============================================================
# - I recommend you create a repo first and clone it.
# - Drag this folder into your repo and then push when you are done.
#
#
# Complete each task underneath its directions.
# 
#
# RULES:
# - Use ONLY concepts we have learned in class.
# - Use the EXACT variable names provided.
# - Do not delete the directions.
# - Your entire Python file must run without errors.
# - Do NOT manually type an answer that Python should calculate.
# - Read carefully. Some questions are intentionally tricky.
